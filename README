This script fixes an issue with the output from the freeware shp2kml(http://www.zonums.com/shp2kml.html) where additional attributes in a shape file are only exported as part of an information balloon and not as independent attributes as ogr2ogr would do. Really, I'd just use ogr2ogr but in my case I was having an issue with the projection

HOW TO:
=======
1. First you need Groovy & Java
2. Pass in the input and output files into the process method.
	e.g process("All_Roads_Msa.kml","All_Roads_Msa.extended.kml")
3. Declare you schema elements
	e.g 
	Schema {
		SimpleField(name:"OBJECTID", type:"int")
		SimpleField(name:"NAME", type:"String")
		SimpleField(name:"RD_SUFFIX", type:"String")
		SimpleField(name:"CITY_NAME", type:"CITY_NAME")
	}
4. Run :-)
